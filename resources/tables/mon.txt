A Red Dragon’s Lair
Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow­capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned
mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating
hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it.
For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls—and the wider
world it seeks to control.
Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of its life, the
enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.
Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the
dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row
● Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20­foot­high
5­foot­radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21
(6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
● A tremor shakes the lair in a 60­foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the
ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
● Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20­foot­radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet
of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the
next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw
or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.
Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the
following effects
● Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.
● Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
● Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures
of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.
If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.
The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and
persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma

points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.

Traits
Petrifying Gaze, When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the
medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the
creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save
begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next
turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed
by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature
does so, it can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at
the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the
medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the

Traits
Multiattack (Vampire Form Only), The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
Shapechanger, If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a
Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. Statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it
is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it

While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its
is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a
flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can
pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage
on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the
damage it takes from sunlight.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day), If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Misty Escape, When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in
the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t
transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its
resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed
until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.
Regeneration, The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight
or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start
of the vampire’s next turn.
Spider Climb, The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an
ability check.
Vampire Weaknesses, The vampire has the following flaws
Forbiddance. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is
incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in
sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
